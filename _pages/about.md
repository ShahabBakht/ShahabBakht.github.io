Welcome! Hi, My name is Shahab Bakhtiari. I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Mila (Quebec AI Institute)](https://mila.quebec/en/) and McGill University. In January 2023, I will start as assistant professor at the department of psychology in University of Montreal. I received my PhD in neuroscience from McGill University, and my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering from University of Tehran.
